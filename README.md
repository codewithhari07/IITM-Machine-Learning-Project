# IITM-Machine-Learning-Project
This ML Project is based on the System Thread Forecaster. The goal in competition is to predict a systemâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that system. The telemetry data containing these properties and the system infections was generated by threat reports collected by system's antivirus software.
